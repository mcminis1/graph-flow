define a dynamic graph
- the graph is an object
- use signature for inputs and outputs

methods are the nodes
edges are inputs and outputs

multiple method decorators
- conditional logic



features
- async first
- workflow streams, no polling
- all objects should be composable
- db integration - postgres w/pgvector

A context is an object
- some index structure
- vector embedding
- multi - values 
- input
- output


A prompt is an object
- structured input
- structured output
- llm config
- testing
- logging


A block is an object
- A graph of prompts
- testing
- logging




a prompt consists of several components
- input variables with types
- prompt template
- llm executor
